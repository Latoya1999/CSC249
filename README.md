1.L.1 Git your feelings
Good morning everybody My favorite sport would be Volley Ball. Because it seems very fun and you get to be in a team jumping hitting a ball lol, But I also like seeing  teams having a bond and having one another back. And togetherness. And I always wanted to play but o have asthma so it sucked for me.
